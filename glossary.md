# Glossary
  
- <ins>Bigram:</ins> Two letters that are back to back in a word.

- <ins>Trigram:</ins> Three letters that are back to back in a word.

- <ins>Same Finger Bigram (SFB):</ins> A bigram that's typed with the same finger. *E.g. `DE` on Qwerty*

  - <ins>Same Finger Skipgram (SFS):</ins> A bigram that's typed with the same finger but separated by 1 or more letters. *E.g. `D_E`*

-  <ins>Lateral Stretch Bigram (LSB):</ins> A bigram that's typed with adjacent fingers, with one stretching laterally. *E.g. `HI` and `'L`*

- <ins>Scissor:</ins> A bigram that's typed with one hand where the shorter finger is one or more rows above the longer finger. *E.g. `WC` and `CR`*

- <ins>Roll:</ins> A trigram where two keys are pressed by different fingers on the same hand, and then a third with the other hand. *E.g. `OUR`*

  - <ins>Inroll:</ins> A roll where the two keys pressed by the same hand go towards the index finger. *E.g. `ONE`*

  - <ins>Outroll:</ins> A roll where the two keys pressed by the same hand go towards the pinky finger. *E.g. `NOT`*

  - <ins>3Roll/Onehand:</ins> A one-handed, three key roll that goes in one direction. *E.g. `SET`*

  - <ins>Redirect:</ins> A onehand that changes directions. *E.g. `SAT`. `SA` is outward, `AT` is inward*

    - <ins>Bad Redirect:</ins> A redirect that does *not* involve the index finger. *E.g. `SAD`*
  
- <ins>Alternate:</ins> A trigram that switches hands for each key. *E.g. `AND`*

- <ins>Alt Fingering:</ins> Pressing a key with a different finger than what the touch typing method intends to avoid a SFB. *E.g. `RG` being pressed with the middle and index fingers instead of just the index*

- <ins>Repeat Key:</ins> A key that repeats the last pressed key. *E.g. `L@` → `LL`* (Double letters make up 2.5% of all bigrams)

- <ins>Magic Key:</ins> A key whose output depends upon the last pressed key, or sequence of keys. It can send anything from a single character to entire words. It can also have a default output for when there was no previously pressed key or if you don't want it to be affected by the last keypress. *E.g. ‎`␣★` → `Shift`. ‎`L★` → `LS`. ‎`T★` → `THE`*
